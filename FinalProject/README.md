# Final Project

Theme Ideas:
- Old school animation/cartoons
- Cats: Like the famous cat clock but more with more cats and automatas
- Salvador Dali: Salvador dali style with a wacky clock + human figure automatas making unnatural movements
- The Pandemic: Credits to Carlos

Initial Concept: I decided on exploring the idea of COVID 19 and the pandemic and the first thing that stuck was the sentence that is said to everybody over and over again "wash your hands"

It is simple and not very complex right now but my idea is to have a a giant figure of an adrogynous human where their head and arms would move in an arc as if they were sneezing every fifteen minutes or so. As the arc is moving using a servo motor, while a stepper motor powers a cam that simulates water moving (Insperation from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djn1YRHZ8lQ). The clock itself would be a mechanical one on the face of the sink where the water is at.
