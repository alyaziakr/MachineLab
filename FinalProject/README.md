# Final Project

# April 1st 
Theme Ideas:
- Old school animation/cartoons
- Cats: Like the famous cat clock but more with more cats and automatas
- Salvador Dali: Salvador dali style with a wacky clock + human figure automatas making unnatural movements
- The Pandemic: Credits to Carlos

Initial Concept: I decided on exploring the idea of COVID 19 and the pandemic and the first thing that stuck was the sentence that is said to everybody over and over again "wash your hands"

It is simple and not very complex right now but my idea is to have a a giant figure of an adrogynous human where their head and arms would move in an arc as if they were sneezing every fifteen minutes or so. As the arc is moving using a servo motor, while a stepper motor powers a cam that simulates water moving (Insperation from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djn1YRHZ8lQ). The clock itself would be a mechanical one on the face of the sink where the water is at.

# April 6th

Main Idea: Art

Description: A figure moving to create a piece of art: the first 15 minutes mark the figure is in the process of starting the drawing. At the 30 minute mark the art work changes to a mid-way sketch and at the hour mark the art work is finished.

Initial Sketches:

Figure drawing movement mechanic:

# April 8th
  
  * Dimensions: *Still Trying to figure it out*
  * Materials: Acrylic or wood 
  * Fusion 360 implementation plan: 
    I will start of attempting to create the overall mechanic like a simple skeleton with just the movement linkage for the figure and the rotation of the zoetrope. After that I will add all the different parts like the two or three motors I would need from McMaster Carr and I'll try to create the body to the skeleton parts and put them together if that makes sense.
  * Machines used to fabricate: I'm not sure
  * How pieces are going to be attached: The linkages and joints etc. on the figure will be put together using screws and bolts, the other parts like the cam and the zoetrope would be glued together to create the circular shape on the flat surface. But I need to figure out how ill attatch it to the stepper motor underneath it that makes it rotate.

# April 13th

Created more detailed sketches and added estimated dimensions. I decided that I will attempt to replicate main bodies on fusion to make sure of the dimensions then I'll go back to my plan of creating the main skeleton of the machine.

Extra Details on the Zoetrope: One part I'm not sure of how to connect is the stepper motor to the sticks (I don't know if that's the word).

# April 15 and 20

Worked on fusion model:

Created two different models one to work our linkages and one to build the final one with the dimensions

Created dimensions to figure out ratios and dimensions for the final model (that I now realize are too big):

Dimension model work in progress:

The linkages model:

I couldn't figure out how to animate the linkage without moving it myself.

After help I used grounding and allowing all contact to be able to move the rest

# April 22

Redesigned parts of the mechanic because it was unbalanced before:

I remade the fusion project with better dimensions now because they previous one was too large

# April 27

I worked more on the fusion model.

Issues and concerns: 

- Size of stepper motor hub: will it connect properly to the zoetrope and is the platform to prop it up and contain the motor properly?
- Are the slot sizes where the linkages/sticks are in big enough to work or would it break?
- Maybe the cam can be 3D printed because it's rather big/thick?
- Iâ€™m also unsure of the hole sizes for the zoetrope

# April 29

I added support for the torso shaft (1) as well as a clamping hub for the zoetrope (2).

# May 3

Close to final touches:

Combined the shaft and the cam

Added a hub to connect the stepper motor to the shaft

# May 5

Updated the stepper motor and hub/coupler
